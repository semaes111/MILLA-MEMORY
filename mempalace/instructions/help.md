### Delete Commands (Detailed)

Delete a single drawer by ID:

    mempalace delete drawer --id <drawer-id>

Delete drawers by filters:

    mempalace delete drawer --wing <wing> --all --yes
    mempalace delete drawer --wing <wing> --room <room> --all --yes
    mempalace delete drawer --wing <wing> --room <room> --dry-run

Delete a room and all drawers in that room:

    mempalace delete room --name <room> --wing <wing> --yes
    mempalace delete room --name <room> --dry-run
    mempalace delete room --name <room> --all --yes

Delete every room:

    mempalace delete room --all --yes

If you omit --wing for delete room --name <room> and the room exists in more than one wing:

    - Interactive terminal: MemPalace prompts you to choose a wing.
    - Non-interactive mode: the command exits and asks for --wing.

Delete a wing and all drawers in that wing:

    mempalace delete wing --name <wing> --yes
    mempalace delete wing --name <wing> --dry-run

Delete all wings:

    mempalace delete wing --all

Safety behavior:

- Use --dry-run to preview deletions without deleting anything.
- Bulk deletes require --yes.
- For drawer filter deletes, use --all when multiple drawers match.
- delete wing --all uses an interactive confirmation prompt before deleting every wing.
- In non-interactive shells, delete wing --all fails safely instead of guessing.

## Auto-Save Hooks

- Stop hook -- Automatically saves memories every 15 messages. Counts human
  messages in the session transcript (skipping command-messages). When the
  threshold is reached, blocks the AI with a save instruction. Uses
  ~/.mempalace/hook_state/ to track save points per session. If
  stop_hook_active is true, passes through to prevent infinite loops.

- PreCompact hook -- Emergency save before context compaction. Always blocks
  with a comprehensive save instruction because compaction means the AI is
  about to lose detailed context.

Hooks read JSON from stdin and output JSON to stdout. They can be invoked via:

    echo '{"session_id":"abc","stop_hook_active":false,"transcript_path":"..."}' | mempalace hook run --hook stop --harness claude-code

## Architecture

    Wings (projects/people)
      +-- Rooms (topics)
            +-- Closets (summaries)
                  +-- Drawers (verbatim memories)

    Halls connect rooms within a wing.
    Tunnels connect rooms across wings.

The palace is stored locally using ChromaDB for vector search and SQLite for
metadata. No cloud services or API keys required.
